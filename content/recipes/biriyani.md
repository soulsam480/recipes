# Chicken Biriyani
The only thing I do well in the kitchen. I only do chicken biriyani. You can use the same recipie but just swich the chicken with mutton. I have never tried it with mutton but I am sure it will be good.

## Ingredients
- Chicken

I follow a simple rule for chicken. Look at who you're cooking for. Normally a person can eat 250 grams of chicken in biriyani. If some of your friends like chicken, you can increase it to 300 grams. Don't put too much chicken, they should enjoy rice too.

- Rice

Use any basmati rice you like. My scale is 150 grams of rice per person. Again if they like rice you can do 200 grams. But the sweet spot is 250 grams of chicken and 150 grams of rice.

- Curd

For marination and raita

- Onions
